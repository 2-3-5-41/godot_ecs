# godot_ecs
What if Godot 4.1 and Bevy got married? Well, you'd get one interesting duo of data driven goodness.

## In Development
First priority of this crate is to get most, if not all `RenderingServer` functions integrated as bevy_ecs components and resources in a manner that mimics Godot's node and resource system.
