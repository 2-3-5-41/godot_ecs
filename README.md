# godot_ecs
What if Godot 4.1 and Bevy got married? Well, you'd get one interesting duo of data driven goodness.

## In Development
> **This crate is not production ready** ⚠️
>
> This crate serves as an example, *for now*, as to how you can use `bevy_ecs` as a means to directly interact with Godot through GlobalScope objects like the `RenderingServer`.

## Purpose
This crate's purpose is to bring in an alternative way to use Rust with Godot using it's low level objects like the `RenderingServer`, `PhysicsServer3D`, and others.
