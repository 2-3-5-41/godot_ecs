# godot_ecs
What if Godot 4.1 and Bevy got married? Well, you'd get one interesting duo of data driven goodness.

## In Development
This crate is far from production ready, and I plan to focus souly on everything related to interacting with the `RenderingSerer` and the other Godot objects/singletons that are used with the rendering server.

## Why?
Why not combine two super powers (i.e, Godot Servers, and Bevy's ECS) into an alternative _hopefully_ performant method of creating games and systems in Godot through GDExtensions?
